# R-10.9 Draw the 11-entry hash table that results from using the hash function,
# h(i)=(3i+5) mod 11, to hash the keys 12, 44, 13, 88, 23, 94, 11, 39, 20,
# 16, and 5, assuming collisions are handled by chaining.
#
# R-10.10 What is the result of the previous exercise, assuming collisions are handled
# by linear probing?
#
# R-10.11 Show the result of Exercise R-10.9, assuming collisions are handled by
# quadratic probing, up to the point where the method fails.
#
#
# R-10.12 What is the result of Exercise R-10.9 when collisions are handled by double
# hashing using the secondary hash function h(k) = 7âˆ’(k mod 7)?
