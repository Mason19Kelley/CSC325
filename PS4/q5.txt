Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Write a Python function with the signature solve(nums) that returns the maximum amount to rob,
where nums of the Python list of the amount at each house.


class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        length = len(nums)
        if (length < 3):
            return max(nums)
        money = [nums[0], max(nums[0:2])]
        for i in range(2, length):
            money.append(max(nums[i] + money[-2], money[-1]))
        return money[-1]
