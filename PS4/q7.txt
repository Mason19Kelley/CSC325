1. An adjacency list should be used. The space used by an adjacency matrix in the worst possible case is O(V^2), whereas that used by the adjacency list is O(|V|+|E|).
There are 10,000 vertices and 20,000 edges, and 10,000^2 > 10,000 + 20,000 in the worst case.

2. Both could be used. In the case of a complete graph with (n 2) edges, both have space complexities of O(V^2); therefore, it depends on the weight of the edges.

3. An adjacency matrix should be used. The time complexity for querying in an adjacency list is O(|V|) and the time complexity for querying in an adjacency matrix is O(1).
