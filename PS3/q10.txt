Consider a version of deterministic quick-sort where we pick as our pivot
the median of the d last elements in the input sequence of n elements, for
a fixed, constant odd number d â‰¥ 3. What is the asymptotic worst-case
running time of quick-sort in this case?

The worst case will be O(n^2) because the worst case is when the greatest or smallest elements are picked creating a linear tree.
The sizes of the subtrees will be d+(d-1)+(d-2)...(d-n) giving a result of O(n^2)
