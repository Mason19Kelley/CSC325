Consider a version of deterministic quick-sort where we pick as our pivot
the median of the d last elements in the input sequence of n elements, for
a fixed, constant odd number d â‰¥ 3. What is the asymptotic worst-case
running time of quick-sort in this case?

The worst case will be O(n^2) because the run time of execution of a quick sort would be O(n*h) where h is
the height of the tree and the traversal of the height of the tree is O(n) therefore O(n*n) = O(n^2)
