C-13.31 In the art gallery guarding problem we are given a line L that repre-
sents a long hallway in an art gallery. We are also given a set X =

{x0,x1,...,xnâˆ’1} of real numbers that specify the positions of paintings
in this hallway. Suppose that a single guard can protect all the paintings
within distance at most 1 of his or her position (on both sides). Design
an algorithm for finding a placement of guards that uses the minimum
number of guards to guard all the paintings with positions in X.


def artGallery(X):
	guard = []
	X.sort()
	for x in X:
	# last guard + distance of his or her position on either side
		if (len(guard) == 0 or x > guard[-1] + 1):
			guard.append(x+1)
	return guard

X = [1, 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 6]
print(artGallery(X))

# output = [2, 6]
