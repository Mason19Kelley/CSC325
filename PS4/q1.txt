R-13.3 Draw a figure illustrating the comparisons done by brute-force pattern
matching for the text "aaabaadaabaaa" and pattern "aabaaa".
R-13.4 Repeat the previous problem for the Boyer-Moore algorithm, not counting
the comparisons made to compute the last(c) function.

R-13.5 Repeat Exercise R-13.3 for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, not count-
ing the comparisons made to compute the failure function.
