#Define the internal path length, I(T), of a tree T to be the sum of the
#depths of all the internal positions in T. Likewise, define the external path
#length, E(T), of a tree T to be the sum of the depths of all the external
#positions in T. Show that if T is a proper binary tree with n positions, then
#E(T) = I(T) +nâˆ’1.
