Of the n! possible inputs to a given comparison-based sorting algorithm,
what is the absolute maximum number of inputs that could be correctly
sorted with just n comparisons?

There are n+1 possible combinations of list sequences in which there
will only be n comparisons. n comparisons happen when a single element
is out of place in the list and there a n possible locations for this single 
element to be. The +1 in n+1 comes from trying to sort an already sorted list.
The algorithm still needs to go through every element once to check if the
sequence is sorted.
