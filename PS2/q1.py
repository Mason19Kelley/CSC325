#Let T be an ordered tree with more than one node. Is it possible that the
#preorder traversal of T visits the nodes in the same order as the postorder
#traversal of T? If so, give an example; otherwise, explain why this cannot
#occur. Likewise, is it possible that the preorder traversal of T visits the
#nodes in the reverse order of the postorder traversal of T? If so, give an
#example; otherwise, explain why this cannot occur.
