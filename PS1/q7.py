if the method self.is_empty() were executed, self._front would be incremented by 1. given that self._front is initialized as 0 in the constructor
and self._front = (self._front + 1) % len(self._data) in this resizing method, self._front would become (0+1) % len(self._data), or 1. 
in this case, at lines 53-55, one the first run-through of this for loop, k = 0 and self._data[k] = old[1]; however, in the modified code, for k = 0,
self._data[k] = old[k], or self._data[0] = old[0]. this is simply the incorrect index associated with the desired element to be added to self._data from old.
